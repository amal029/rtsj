Real-time operating systems~\cite{barry2009using} usually provide two
types of mechanisms for introducing real-time in the developed program:
(1) the ability to perform a timeout and (2) the ability to run tasks
periodically with some real-time period $T$. We would like to provide
similar mechanisms in reactive languages for real-time program
development. In fact, we provide \textit{exact} and \textit{non exact}
real-time control mechanisms -- a generalization of the two real-time
mechanisms introduced in real-time operating systems.

\subsubsection{Programming using the non exact real-time control
  construct; the \textrm{\texttt{wait\_inbetween}} statement}
\label{sec:progr-using-non}

\label{fig:1}
\end{figure}

The \texttt{wait\_inbetween (M..N)} statement postpones the program
control flow from proceeding to the following statement for a minimum of
$M$ time units and a maximum of $N$ time units, as shown in
Figure~\ref{d:b}.

Consider a machine used to test human response time and collect this
data for future research purposes. The machine switches on a green light
on a touch screen for anywhere \textit{in between} 50.3 ms to 200.3 ms,
if the user can touch this green light then she is successful and \hj{an
  integer \texttt{1} is sent to another process in order to increase an
  integer counter, if unsuccessful a \texttt{0} is sent instead to
  decrease the counter}. Different statistics and analyses on human
responsiveness can be based on the collected data.

The SystemJ pseudo-code~\cite{amal10} for such a system, along with the
expected timing behavior of the \texttt{wait\_inbetween} statement, is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:1}. We use the SystemJ language in this paper,
because being a \textit{Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous}
(GALS) language it helps us easily describe a larger class of systems
(like HRTCS in Figure~\ref{delay:a}) compared to purely synchronous
languages like Esterel. Moreover, being a super-set of Esterel, SystemJ
allows us to explore the marriage of real-time and logical time not only
in the GALS, but also in the synchronous setting.

The SystemJ program in Figure~\ref{delay:a} is divided into two
\hj{mutually asynchronous} clock-domains, the first clock-domain
continuously displays a green light (\texttt{GREEN\_LIGHT} signal) on
the touch screen sensor and waits for the user to respond. If the user
is able to touch the screen within the specified time of at least 50.3
ms and at most 200.3 ms, a positive response is sent to the second
clock-domain. All the SystemJ programming constructs used to implement
this system are described in Table~\ref{tab:1} \hj{and more details can
  be found in~\cite{amal10}}. The \texttt{wait\_inbetween}
specification, which models the non exact postponement between 50.3 ms
and 200.3 ms is not supported in the current language and cannot be
compiled with the current SystemJ compiler. We introduce such
\texttt{wait\_inbetween} statements in SystemJ. Such non exact real-time
mechanisms are useful for developing systems where the real-time
postponement is not known or should not be known a priori.

\subsubsection{Programming a timeout using the non exact real-time
  construct; the \texttt{wait\_atleast} statement}
\label{sec:progr-time-using}

\begin{figure}[b!]
	\centering
	\vspace{-10pt}
        \begin{SubFloat}{\label{dd:a}Timeout waiting for the input
            signal \texttt{DoorOpened}}
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=sysj,morekeywords={abort,await,emit,present,trap,pause,exit,wait_atleast,suspend}]
trap(T){
  abort(DoorOpened){
    wait_atleast(10000 ms);
    exit(T);  
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{SubFloat}
\begin{SubFloat}{\label{dd:b}Timing diagram -- the X-axis shows the
    execution of the \texttt{wait\_atleast} statement. The Y-axis is the
    time elapsed. The arrow shows one possible expiration of
    \texttt{wait\_atleast (10000 ms)} statement.}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{FF2}
\end{SubFloat}
\caption{Programming a timeout with \texttt{wait\_atleast}}
\label{dd}
\end{figure}

The \texttt{wait\_atleast (M)} statement is used to postpone the program
control flow from proceeding to the next statment for a minimum of $M$
time units. The maximum postponement is unbounded, but countable
(Figure~\ref{dd:b}).

There are many instances when one would like to wait on an input from
environment for only a specified amount of time. If the signal is not
received, then a timeout is generated so that the program can make
progress. Such a timeout programmed in the SystemJ pseudo-code along
with its timing behavior is shown in Figure~\ref{dd}. The SystemJ
program is waiting on an input signal, \texttt{DoorOpened}, from the
environment for 10 seconds and makes progress irrespective of the
reception of this signal after 10 seconds.

The timing diagram, Figure~\ref{dd:b}, shows that the
\texttt{wait\_atleast} statement waits for a \textit{at least} 10
seconds, but unlike \texttt{wait\_inbetween} there is no upper bound.
For example in Figure~\ref{dd:b} program can proceed to the next
statement at 11 seconds. The statement following the
\texttt{wait\_atleast} statement is executed after a finite countable,
but unbounded postponement. Such a statement is useful for programming
low priority tasks.


\subsubsection{Programming periodic tasks using the exact real-time
  construct; the \texttt{wait\_exact} statement}
\label{sec:progr-using-exact}

The previous wait statements are non exact, i.e., the \hj{time of}
execution of the statement following the wait statement cannot be
controlled exactly. The final variant we introduce allows doing exactly
that. We call it \texttt{wait\_exact} and this statement can be used to
program exact timeouts, periodic tasks, etc.

\begin{figure}[t!]
  \centering
	\vspace{-10pt}
        \begin{SubFloat}{\label{pp:a}Periodically emitting signal S}
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=sysj,morekeywords={emit,trap,pause,exit,wait_exact}]
while(true) { 
 wait_exact (1 ms); 
 emit S; 
 //do something 
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{SubFloat}

\begin{SubFloat}{\label{p1:b}Timing diagram -- the X-axis shows the
    execution of the \texttt{wait\_exact} statement. The Y-axis is the
    time elapsed. The arrow shows the \textit{only} possible expiration
    of the \texttt{wait\_exact (1 ms)} statement.}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{FF3}
\end{SubFloat}
  \caption{Programming a periodic task with wait\_exact}
  \label{fig:p1}
  \vspace{-10pt}
\end{figure}

One such example; periodic emission of a signal to the environment is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:p1}. As before, upon execution of
\texttt{wait\_exact (1 ms)} statement, the time starts elapsing. But,
unlike in previous cases the following statement needs to be executed
exactly after 1 ms has passed, as shown in Figure~\ref{p1:b}.
