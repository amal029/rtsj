\section{Introduction and motivation}
\label{sec:intr-motiv}

Reactive languages~\cite{gber05,amal10} are a class of programming
languages used for designing and implementing \textit{reactive} systems,
which continuously respond to input from their environment. These
languages have been successfully used in programming a plethora of
systems such as fly by wire in Airbus~\cite{eairbus}, security
surveillance systems~\cite{amal121}, etc. Usually the working
environment of these reactive systems is also real-time. Yet, these
languages do not support describing real-time as first class language
constructs. For example, one cannot describe a simple real-time delay
\texttt{delay 0.2 ms} in these languages. These languages are based on
formal semantics, essential for the formal verification of functional
correctness of the developed programs, but leave non-functional
properties such as timing behavior as an implementation
detail~\cite{ringler00,boldt07}.

These languages only support discrete \textit{logical} clock rather than
a continuous clock. The period of the discrete logical clock (also
referred to as a \textit{logical tick}) is determined by the
responsiveness of the program and as opposed to a discrete
\textit{physical} clock is elastic. Although this timing model has
worked well for these languages in designing discrete systems there is
obviously a need to introduce continuous time since often implementation
models are in the continuous time
domain~\cite{DBLP:journals/pieee/SifakisTY03}.

\input{motivation}

The fundamental contribution of this paper is the inclusion of real-time
constructs in GALS (and its subset synchronous) reactive
languages. Moreover, our contributions can be further refined as
follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The real-time is modeled in the $\mathbb{Q}^{>0}$ domain of
  numbers, i.e., non-negative rational numbers.
\item We consider the property of \textit{non maximal-parallelism},
  i.e., we consider scheduling on constrained resources to be an
  integral part of the solution. To our knowledge we are the very first
  to do so.
\item Our solution does not change the functional or timing semantics of
  GALS and its subset synchronous programs, in fact, our solution does
  not require one to change the compiler at all.
\item Our solution gives complete control of under and over
  approximation of real-time to the system designer.
\end{enumerate}
