  abstract = {conomics of the Welfare State discusses the different parts of the
	welfare system,in particular, cash benefits, the health service and
	education. The text argues that the welfare state exists not just
	to help the underprivileged, but also for efficiency reasons in areas
	where private markets would be inefficient or would not exist at
	all. The book has a separate chapter on the economics of higher education
	and it contains increased references to developments in the EU. Also
	included are a number of largely forward looking topics: - extended
	discussion of insurance to cover disability and long-term care -
	challenges to the welfare state including demographic change, globalization,
	changes in family structure and changes in the structure of jobs
	- debates about the welfare state Suitable for students of both economics
	related disciplines, the book encourages greater accessibility for
	students and contains a non-technical appendix in every chapter,
	diagrams, additional readings, worked examples and end of chapter
	discussion questions. ONLINE RESOURCE CENTRE Includes PowerPoint
	slides, web links and further reading.},

	can vary greatly as a function of the selected data distributions,
	and that some data distributions can not be supported. Also, we describe
	how the parallel language extensions, though simplifying the programming,
	do not address the performance problems found in parallel file systems.
	\par We have devised an alternative scheme for conducting parallel
	I/O - the Two-Phase Access Strategy - which guarantees higher and
	more consistent performance over a wider spectrum of data distributions.
	We have designed and implemented runtime primitives that make use
	of the two-phase access strategy to conduct parallel I/O, and facilitate
	the programming of parallel I/O operations. We describe these primitives
	in detail and provide performance results which show that I/O access
	rates are improved by up to several orders of magnitude. Further,
	we show that the variation in performance over various data distributions
	is restricted to within a factor of 2 of the best access rate.},
  comment = {Much of this is the same as delrosario:two-phase, except for section~4

	with a little bit about how it works. It's not clear, for example,
	how their meta-data structures are distributed across the machine.
	They also do not describe their methods for the data redistribution.},

	to specify functionality; however, they have few constructs to specify
	precise timing constraints. LabVIEW is one example of a graphical
	programming language that supports timing specifications in the form
	of timed-loops. In this work, we present a plug-in for LabVIEW Embedded
	that maps the LabVIEW G graphical programming language and its timing
	specifications to the PREcision Timed machine (PRET), an architecture
	that exposes timing instructions in its instruction set architecture.
	We demonstrate the use of the plug-in with a simple producer/consumer
	example that uses timing to enforce synchronization.},

  pages = {132-143},

  abstract = {The ROMIO implementation of the MPI-IO standard provides a portable
	infrastructure for use on top of a variety of underlying storage
	targets. These targets vary widely in their capabilities, and in
	some cases additional effort is needed within ROMIO to support all
	MPI-IO semantics. Two aspects of the interface that can be problematic
	to implement are MPI-IO atomic mode and the shared file pointer access
	routines. Atomic mode requires enforcing strict consistency semantics,
	and shared file pointer routines require communication and coordination
	in order to atomically update a shared resource. For some file systems,
	native locks may be used to implement these features, but not all
	file systems have lock support. In this work, we describe algorithms
	for implementing efficient mutex locks using MPI-1 and the one-sided
	capabilities from MPI-2. We then show how these algorithms may be
	used to implement both MPI-IO atomic mode and shared file pointer
	methods for ROMIO without requiring any features from the underlying
	file system. We show that these algorithms can outperform traditional
	file system lock approaches. Because of the portable nature of these
	algorithms, they are likely useful in a variety of situations where
	distributed locking or coordination is needed in the MPI-2 environment.

  abstract = {I propose to consider the question, "Can machines think?" This should
	begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms "machine" and
	"think." The definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far
	as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous,
	If the meaning of the words "machine" and "think" are to be found
	by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape
	the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, "Can
	machines think?" is to be sought in a statistical survey such as
	a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition
	I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related
	to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words. The new form
	of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call
	the 'imitation game." It is played with three people, a man (A),
	a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The
	interrogator stays in a room apart front the other two. The object
	of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other
	two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X
	and Y, and at the end of the game he says either "X is A and Y is
	B" or "X is B and Y is A." The interrogator is allowed to put questions
	to A and B. We now ask the question, "What will happen when a machine
	takes the part of A in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly
	as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game
	is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our
	original, "Can machines think?"},
