Abstract

Section 1:

Motivation and background with an example. I am thinking of using Tim
Burke's (printer) example, but modified to be GALS.

Section 2:

Related Work, we state all the related-work upfront, there isn't much.

State major contributions of this paper: where do we shine compared to
others as bullet points.

Section 3: Background on SystemJ and real-time.

Subsection a.) Describe in brief the SystemJ language -- syntax and
semantics.

Subsection b.) Give the concept of Worst case Tick time and Best case
tick time for individual SystemJ CD.

Subsection c.) Explain a number of concepts:

1.) WCTT and BCTT are invariant to certain things, timed loop bounds.
2.) Channel communication.

Section 4:

Subsection a.) Introduce the extension to the language -- the wait
statement describe the semantics of this single wait statement.

Subsection b.) Introduce the compilation (rewrite semantics) of these
wait statements to standard SystemJ.

Subsection c.) Give the semantics of the other derived wait statements
-- what do all the different wait statements mean and there usefulness
with examples.

Section 5: Experimental results.

We have 4 benchmarks that we will use.

1.) Runner
2.) Kite 
3.) GALS robot
4.) Printer -- synchronous and GALS versions.


Section 6: Conclusions.
